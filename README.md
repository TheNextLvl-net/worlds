## 🌍 **Worlds – The Ultimate World Management Plugin for Paper & Folia**


Worlds is a modern, lightweight world management plugin designed for **Paper** and **Folia** servers.<br>
It brings seamless world handling with **customization presets**, eliminating the need for extra plugins just to create void or custom flat maps.<br>
Simply pick a predefined preset—or define your own!


### 🔹 **Why Choose Worlds?**

✅ **Vanilla Flat World Preset** – No more extra plugins for void or flat maps<br>
✅ **No Extra Data Files** – Worlds doesn't store extra files, no more messy file syncing when sharing worlds<br>
✅ **Drag & Drop Import** – Just place the world in the folder & use /world import<br>
✅ **Full World Regeneration** – Reset any world (even the Overworld!) with one command<br>
✅ **Modern & Efficient** – Uses up-to-date server mechanics, not outdated methods<br>
✅ **World Keys** – Worlds are referenced by unique keys, improving compatibility with client mods<br>
✅ **Seamless Portal Linking** – Restore vanilla Nether and End portal behavior for custom worlds


### 🔥 **What's Next?**

- **Custom Dimension Type Support** – Like datapacks, but built into the plugin!<br>
  (Currently, Worlds can load custom dimension worlds, but in-game/API creation is coming soon.)

🚀 Simplify world management & unlock new possibilities with Worlds!<br>
